            <h3>Empowering Students Through Robotics</h3>
            <p>
              Since 2017, we have engaged schools in various robotics tournaments, both regional and international. These events
              bring students and teachers together to share learning experiences through robot design, robot games, and project presentations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Supported by industry players and experts, these tournaments provide mentorship and real-life experience on the implementation of
              student-developed solutions. Students aged 6-17 showcase their innovative solutions and share their skills in a fun and collaborative environment.

            <h4>About Inspire Robotics Challenge</h4>
            <p>
            Inspire robotics challenge is a fun filled regional robotics competition bringing together
students aged 4 to 17 years to share, compete and learn from each otherâ€™s experience.
In 3 main age categories as outlined below, students are challenged to think logically and in
teams, come up with solutions to the challenge presented to them.
-Explore for students aged 6-9 years
-Challenge for students aged 10-13 years
-Innovators for students aged 14-17 years
Focusing on 4 key areas of core values, project research, robot design, game and (business
model for innovators) the program aims at inspiring creativity and fostering long term
friendship through shared learning experience.
