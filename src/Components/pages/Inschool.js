              In partnership with schools, we offer engaging and interactive robotics training for students from kindergarten to high school. 
              Our curriculum introduces scientific challenges through stories, pictures, and videos, helping students connect with and better understand our world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through project-based expos and challenges, learners explore new possibilities, share ideas, and expand their knowledge. 
              Our programs foster skills in computational thinking, problem-solving, and evidence-based discussions.
